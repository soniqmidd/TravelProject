            <h3>Why Athens?</h3>
            <h2>The 6th oldest city in the world</h2>
            <p>
              Athens is steeped in history and culture, from the ancient ruins
              dotted around the city, to its fascinating museums. You'll never
              be stuck for things to see and do, whether you're exploring the
              winding streets of Plaka or admiring the grand Temple of Olympian
              Zeus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece. It dominates the
              Attica region with its earliest human presence starting somewhere
              between the 11th and 7th millennium BC. This city is also an
              ancient home of philosophy and the birthplace of Western
              civilisations. In fact it boasts of habitation that goes back long
              before the days of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. The city
              withstood the test of times and was a subject of complete
              destruction following the Dorian and Persian invasions. Today,
              Athens is a sprawling metropolis and the oldest capital city in
              Europe.

                <p>
                  The Greco's project restaurants begin their history in the
                  center of Athens, initially on Mitropoleos street in Syntagma.
                  Monastirakiou and recently in the heart of the most commercial
                  street of Athens, on Ermou & Evangelistrias Street. Very soon
                  they become favorite tasting destinations for our Greek and
                  foreign friends and a point of reference when we talk about
                  Greek cuisine.

                  B madame is small, classy and has the aura of an old

                  to turn haute pastry into street. Having pure ingredients and
                  quality as its central axis, it provides sweets that have a
                  shelf life of only 24 hours, while at the same time they have
                  the signature of a nutritionist!
