            <h3>Why Athens?</h3>
            <h2>The 6th oldest city in the world</h2>
            <p>
              Athens is steeped in history and culture, from the ancient ruins
              dotted around the city, to its fascinating museums. You'll never
              be stuck for things to see and do, whether you're exploring the
              winding streets of Plaka or admiring the grand Temple of Olympian
              Zeus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece. It dominates the
              Attica region with its earliest human presence starting somewhere
              between the 11th and 7th millennium BC. This city is also an
              ancient home of philosophy and the birthplace of Western
              civilisations. In fact it boasts of habitation that goes back long
              before the days of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. The city
              withstood the test of times and was a subject of complete
              destruction following the Dorian and Persian invasions. Today,
              Athens is a sprawling metropolis and the oldest capital city in
              Europe.
